# WAVI.jl is now on the Julia Package Registry

We are pleased to announce that WAVI.jl v0.0.3 is now officially on the
[Julia package registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General).

<!-- more -->
This means WAVI can now be installed directly using `Pkg`:

```julia
Pkg.add("WAVI")
using WAVI
```

We are constantly working to make WAVI.jl a friendlier, and easier to use open source package.
Check out our updated [installation instructions](https://rjarthern.github.io/WAVI.jl/installation_instructions/).

Happy ice sheet modelling!
