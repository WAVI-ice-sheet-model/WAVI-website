## WAVIhpc: run WAVI ensembles an HPC using WAVIhpc

WAVIhpc is a configuration and helper repository to assist with running WAVI ensembles locally or on
HPCs using [model-ensembler](https://github.com/environmental-forecasting/model-ensembler).

WAVIhpc provides convenience functions, templates for running on different HPC platforms, and
specific use cases you can base you ensembles on, such as [MISMIP](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/2283/2020/).

## model-ensembler: powering WAVIhpc to run ensembles

`model-ensembler` is a general purpose Python package that supports running ensembles. It is the
backbone of WAVIhpc, but can be used for other models as well.
