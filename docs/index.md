## About WAVI.jl

**WAVI.jl is an ice sheet model for everyone.**

WAVI.jl, or _Wavelet-based Adaptive-grid Vertically-integrated Ice-model_, is a fast and friendly ice
sheet model, written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), initially developed at
the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/).

WAVI.jl is designed to make ice sheet modelling more accessible to beginners and low-level users,
whilst including sufficient detail to be used for addressing cutting-edge research questions.

To facilitate accessibility, WAVI.jl includes a simple, user friendly API.
