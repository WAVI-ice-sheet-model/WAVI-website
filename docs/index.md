# About WAVI.jl

WAVI.jl is an ice sheet model written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), initially developed at
the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/). WAVI.jl is designed to make ice sheet
modelling more accessible to beginners and low-level users, whilst including sufficient detail to
be used for addressing cutting-edge research questions. To facilitate accessibility, WAVI.jl
includes a simple, user friendly API.
